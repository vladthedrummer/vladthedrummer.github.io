          <p>With photography now in the picture I wanted to go to the next step.  In my youth I have posted videos to YouTube that have been cringe worthy.  If I could I would definitely try to get those back and post them back up.  It is a known fact that there isnâ€™t a well-known vlogger/youtuber out of the Chicago land area.  I wanted to try to tap into that market but going into something like that was a huge challenge.  It took me a whole year to upload my first edited video since I was trying to learn on the fly how Premiere Pro works.</p>
          
          <p>  I was not satisfied with my first episode, but I was elated with having to upload something that I know I worked hard on.  With time I will learn the tips and tricks and try to upload videos on a weekly basis in an episodic fashion. I also like to record some of my gameplay footage from my good old league days.</p>
